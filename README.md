# Custom-text-normalization-and-correction-pipeline
Designed a custom text normalization and correction pipeline to resolve spelling variations in student career inputs using vectorized character mapping.

Engineered a cosine similarity function to match user-submitted text against predefined career labels.

Utilized NumPy and pandas to perform efficient data transformations, similarity scoring, and classification of corrected career aspirations.

Visualized the distribution of cleaned career preference data using matplotlib, generating interpretable frequency-based bar charts.
